mobileSwipableList
==================

A list that reveals actionable buttons on swipe.

Click [Here](http://nathansass.github.io/mobileSwipableList/) to swipe away.

Check it out on your mobile phone. It will be wierd on desktop as there are no queries for larger screen sizes (yet!) 

###More Details
I wrote it as a ractive decorator so it would be easy to use in another project. The decorator is very clean in the html markup.
```
<li decorator="swipeable"></li>
```
And then the javascript will toggle the correct classes. 

I'm controlling the animations with css3.
